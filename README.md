# hackpad

This is my (shrey's) hackpad

Features:

Case EC11 Rotary encoder for sound and volume (please double check if i did it right) 2 WS2812B RGB LEDs. 4 Keys

CAD Model:

This has 2 parts to the case, which will be held together with 4 M3 Screws

I used MX_V2 for the keyswitch footprints. I think in retrospect, I should've added a ground plane

Firmware Overview This hackpad uses QMK firmware for everything.

The rotary encoder changes volume. press to mute The 4 keys currently act as macros, which The OLED is a cat!!

I might add more in the future! That's it for now

BOM: Here should be everything you need to make this hackpad

4x Cherry MX Switches 4x DSA Keycaps 5x M3x5x4 Heatset inserts 4x M3x16mm SHCS Bolts 2x WS2812B LEDs 1x EC11 Rotary Encoder 1x XIAO RP2040 1x Case

Very Important!

i have no idea if anything will work, i followed the hackpad tutorial on the website, and added a rotary encoder with the help of google. Please, please make sure everything will work. This is my first time creating the wiring for anything.
